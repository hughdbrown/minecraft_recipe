# Description
This is a new feature that allows modification of the items and blocks scanned from the pack (the MCADDON file):
- delete an entire item/block which will remove its behaviors and resources in the MCADDON file
- edit the display names of items and blocks
- edit the identifier names of items and blocks (a change of identifier names affects all locations in the file)

# New navigation tab
This feature gets a new navigation tab on the left hand side. The text for this is "Edit Blocks/Items".

# User interface
When the navigation tab is selected, the right hand panel changes to display:
- a file selector for the MCADDON file
- once selected, an index of the items and blocks is displayed. There is a separate section for Items first and then Blocks.
- Each item and block has a display name and an identifier name. These are editable.
- The entire item/block thing is deletable by pressing a deletion icon on the right side. There is a confirm sequence for this.
- The user can edit multiple item/block things and save changes via export (like other features) all at once.
- once the changes have been saved, a download button will appear for the changed MCADDON file.
